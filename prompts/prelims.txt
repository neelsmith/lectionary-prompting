Write a single-page webapp using HTML, CSS and javascript for working with readings from the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). Always provide a complete single file in your replies to queries.

Start by finding a Sunday date to use: if today is a Sunday, use today's date; otherwise use the date of next Sunday. Determine which lectionary cycle the Sunday date belongs to, that is, A, B, or C. Display the Sunday date and the lectionary cycle. 

---

Now add a date picker to let the user optionally choose a different date to use instead of the default Sunday date.




 Find the assigned readings for that date in the RCL. List the readings for Old Testament, New Testament, Psalm and Gospel.
