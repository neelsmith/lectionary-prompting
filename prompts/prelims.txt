Write a single-page webapp using HTML, CSS and javascript for working with readings from the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). Always provide a complete single file in your replies to queries.

Start by finding a Sunday date to use: if today is a Sunday, use today's date; otherwise use the date of next Sunday. Determine which lectionary cycle the Sunday date belongs to, that is, A, B, or C. Display the Sunday date and the lectionary cycle. 

---

Now add a date picker to let the user optionally choose a different date to use instead of the default Sunday date.

---

Please find the calendar dates for the the first and last Sunday in the selected lectionary cycle. Include these in parentheses next to the display of the cycle.

---

Add a one-month view of the calendar. Set it by default to display the month with the date the user selected. Allow the user to navigate the month display forward and backward.

---

On the month display, label Christmas Day and Easter if they fall within the displayed dates.

---

Now label the four Sundays of Advent on the month display (e.g., "Advent 1", "Advent 2"...). Frame these Sundays with a light purple border (the liturgical color of Advent.)

---

Now remove the initial date picker: let the user use only the month display of the calendar to choose a date. Also, frame the date for Christmas Day in the same purple as for Advent Sundays.

---







 Find the assigned readings for that date in the RCL. List the readings for Old Testament, New Testament, Psalm and Gospel.
