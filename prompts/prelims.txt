Write a single-page webapp using HTML, CSS and javascript for working with readings from the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). Always provide a complete single file in your replies to queries.

Start by finding a Sunday date to use: if today is a Sunday, use today's date; otherwise use the date of next Sunday. Determine which lectionary cycle the Sunday date belongs to, that is, A, B, or C. Display the Sunday date and the lectionary cycle. 

---

Now add a date picker to let the user optionally choose a different date to use instead of the default Sunday date.

---

Please find the calendar dates for the the first and last Sunday in the selected lectionary cycle. Include these in parentheses next to the display of the cycle.

---

Add a one-month view of the calendar. Set it by default to display the month with the date the user selected. Allow the user to navigate the month display forward and backward.




 Find the assigned readings for that date in the RCL. List the readings for Old Testament, New Testament, Psalm and Gospel.
