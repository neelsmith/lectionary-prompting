Write a single-page webapp using HTML, CSS and javascript for working with readings from the Revised Common Lectionary (RCL). Always provide a complete single file in your replies to queries.

Start by finding a Sunday date to use: if today is a Sunday, use today's date; otherwise use the date of next Sunday. Determine which lectionary cycle the Sunday date belongs to, that is, A, B, or C. Display the Sunday date and the lectionary cycle. Find the calendar dates for the the first and last Sunday in the selected lectionary cycle. Include these in parentheses next to the display of the cycle.

Add a one-month view of the calendar. Set it by default to display the month with the current date. Allow the user to navigate the month display forward and backward, and to select a date by clicking on it. When the user changes the displayed month, the label giving the lectionary year (A,B,C) with its beginning and end dates should be updated so that it always includes the currently displayed month.

On the month display, label Christmas Day and Easter if they fall within the displayed dates. Label the four Sundays of Advent on the month display (e.g., "Advent 1", "Advent 2"...). Frame these Sundays with a light purple border (the liturgical color of Advent.)
Frame the date for Christmas Day in the same purple as for Advent Sundays. 


---

Label Epiphany if it falls within the displayed dates. Label any Sundays between Christmas Day and Epiphany as "Christmastide 1", "Christmastide 2", etc. 

---

Use black text for all labels on the calendar: use color only to frame the dates when I give you instructions for that.

Label Ash Wednesday on the month display and frame it in black. Label the Sunday before Ash Wednesday "Transfiguration Sunday". Label the Sundays between Epiphany and Ash Wednesday "Epiphany 1", "Epiphany 2", etc., and frame them in a light green, the liturgical color of Epiphany. There should be no frame on Transfiguration Sunday. 

---

You broke everything. Nothing displays.
---

Good. Label the Sundays between Ash Wednesday and Easter as "Lent 1", "Lent 2", etc, and frame them in the same purple as Advent. Change the label on the Sunday before Easter to "Palm Sunday", and frame it in red, the liturgical color for Palm Sunday. Label Pentecost on the month display, and frame it in red. Label the Sundays between Easter and Pentecost "Easter 1", "Easter 2", etc. 

---

You labelled the Lent Sundays wrong. You started indexing from 0 ("Lent 0") but I told you to start from 1 ("Lent 1"). Fix that.

Label the Sunday after Pentecost "Trinity Sunday", with no frame. Label the last Sunday before Advent "Christ the King", with no frame. Label the Sundays between Trinity Sunday and Christ the King as "Pentecost 2", "Pentecost 3", etc. (Note that we start with 2 since we've already labeled the first Sunday after Pentecost as Trinity Sunday.) The Sundays labeled "Pentecost 2" etc should be framed in the same green as used for Epiphanytide.

No dates are actually labelled except Sunday. Fix that.

QUARRY:

---

Great. Now I want to add a new feature. I’m attaching a delimited-text file with assigned readings for liturgical year A. The delimited-text data has 5 columns separated by the pipe character '|', and has a header line. The first column gives the name of the labelled data, 2nd is the assigned Psalms, 3rd is the Old Testament, 4th is the New Testament, and 5th is the Gospel. If the user clicks on a labeled day on the month display in year A **NOT** in the season of Epiphany (identified by labels like "Epiphany 1", "Epiphany 2"), list the assigned readings for the Psalms, Old Testament, New Testament and Gospel. 

---

Nothing happens when I click on a labelled date in year A.

---

Excellent. Let’s do the same for year B using this data set.

---

Clicking on labelled dates in year A works, but nothing happens when I click on a labelled date in year B.

---

Great. Now let's implement functionality for year C using this data set.
---

Wonderful. Now I want to change the behavior. Now I want users to be able to see reading selectionns when they click on a date in Epiphany labelled "Epiphany 1", "Epiphany 2", etc. but *not* when they click on a date in the season of Pentecost labelled "Pentecost 1", "Pentecost 2", etc.  

---

For some reason, readings for dates labeled "Christmastide 1", etc, are not being displayed. Could you fix this?

---

Now I'd like to add support for Sundays in Pentecost labelled "Pentecost 1", "Pentecost 2", etc. The readings for these Sundays appear in the data for years A,B,C as "Proper 1", "Proper 2" etc. To match the correct entry for a "Proper" with a Sunday in the Pentecost series,  we begin by counting *backward* from "Christ the King" Sunday. "Christ the King" is always the same as "Proper 29". The Sunday *before* Christ the King is given the readings from "Proper 28"; the Sunday two weeks before Christ the King is given the readings from "Proper 27", etc. The longest possible sequence of Pentecost Sundays would count all the way back to "Proper 1" but in most years, we will reach the Sunday labelled "Epiphany 1" before then.

---

Not getting any readings displayed when clicking on dates in Pentecost. The correct readings selected from the listing of Propers should be displayed when the user clicks on a date in Pentecost.

---

Great! For the Sundays in Pentecost where the readings are drawn from entries labelled "Proper N", could you add a reference to the Proper in the heading above the readings? For example, if the heading was "Readings for Pentecost 23 (Year C)", and the displayed readings were taken from Proper 28, could make the heading "Readings for Pentecost 23 (Year C, Proper 28)" ?

---

Great! Now a new feature to display the text of assigned passages. Next to each selection, please add a checkbox. When the user checks a passage, display the following text immediately below it:

- for the New Testament and Gospel, display the passage in two parallel columns, with the passage in the Greek New Testament on the left, and the passage in the Latin Vulgate on the right
- for the Psalm and Old Testament, display the passage in three paralll columns, with the text of the Greek Septuagint on the left, the Latin Vulgate in the middle, and the passage in the Masoretic Hebrew text on the right.

---

This broke the app: it no longer displays the assigned passages for the selected day.

---

No better. Still broken.
